# PeakPerformance
Trivia Practice Website

Hello! This project is a collaboration between myself, Paul Siri, and a friend Jared Cubilla. We are both huge fans of trivia, competing in local high school "Reach For The Top" events, and we often use sites such as protobowl to practice for events. However, we wanted a way to practice that was more similar to the structure of Reach For The Top trivia, so we decided to make PeakPerformance!

It is still a work in progress and we will continue to update the site in the following months with new features and questions!

Feel free to contact us at peakperformancetrivia@gmail.com if you have any suggestions or questions about the site!
